		<p style="color: #669DB3FF"> In October 2019, when I was in Diploma Business Study, me and my classmates went a trip to Shah Alam Selangor arranged by our lecturer, Madam Mas Ayu Diana to visit Yakult Malaysia because of our project. When arrived at there, we entered the factory and were lead to a presentation hall with seats by the tour guide. We were briefed about the company's history and it's manufacturing procedure. But during the production line tour, we were not allowed to capture any picture because of their roles. </p>

		<p style="color: #669DB3FF"> From the visit, I gained experiences and better understanding about the real working environment and their product's process. Besides, we were able to see the main production plant during the tour, which may enhance our knowledge in chemical industry. After the trip, we had gained  the knowledge about the manufacturing of milk cultured drink which is Yakult. It was so interesting, we had so much fun also we get a free Yakult drink and several souvenirs from them. </p>
